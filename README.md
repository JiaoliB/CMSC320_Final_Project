# Introduction
The introduction should motivate your work: what is your topic? What  question(s) are you trying to answer with your analysis? Why is answering those questions important?
# Data Curation
Cite the source(s) of your data. Explain what it is. Transform the data so that it is ready for analysis. For example, set up a database and use SQL to query for data, or organize a pandas DataFrame.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (Checkpoint 2)
# Primary Analysis
Based on the results of your exploration, choose a machine learning technique (e.g., classification, regression, clustering, etc.) that will help you answer the questions you posed in the introduction. Explain your reasoning.
# Visualization
Explain the results and insights of your primary analysis with at least one plot. Make sure that every element of the plots are labeled and explained (donâ€™t forget to include a legend!)
# Insights and Conclusions
After reading through the project, does an uninformed reader feel informed about the topic? Would a reader who already knew about the topic feel like they learned more about it?
